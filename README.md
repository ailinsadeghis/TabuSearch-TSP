# Welcome to the TabuSearch-TSP Repository!

## What's All This About?

Hey there, fellow traveler! Ever heard of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)? It's like that frustrating moment when you're planning the perfect road trip but can't decide the best route to hit all your favorite spots without wasting time.

That's where the Tabu Search algorithm swoops in to save the day! It's like having a savvy tour guide who knows all the shortcuts and sneaky backroads to optimize your journey.

## How Does It Work?

Our Python-powered implementation of Tabu Search tackles the TSP head-on with some slick moves:

1. **The Grand Kickoff**: We kickstart the adventure with an initial solution, like throwing a dart at a map and hoping for the best.
2. **Tabu's Little Blacklist**: We keep a watchful eye on where we've been, so we don't accidentally loop back and visit the same place twice (that would be embarrassing).
3. **Scoping Out the 'Hood**: We scout neighboring routes, sniffing out those sweet shortcuts and hidden gems.
4. **The No-No Zone**: We have some rules about where we can't go, based on our taboo list. Gotta respect the boundaries, you know?
5. **Aim High**: Sometimes we break the rules (don't tell anyone!) if it means stumbling upon an even better route than we expected.
6. **The Grand Finale**: We know when to call it quits, usually when we've circled the globe a few times or when we're just too darn tired.
